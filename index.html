        William Shakespeare's <em>Sonnets</em> consists of 
        154 poems, each fourteen lines long (three 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantrain">
            quantrains</a>) followed by a rhyming
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet">couplet</a>.
        <strong>Sonnet 18</strong> is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Shall I compare three to a summer's day? <br />
            Thou are more lovely and more template.
        </p>
